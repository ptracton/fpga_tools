FPGA TOOLS

This project is a place to store a variety of python scripts use to simulate FPGA designs. These tools will allow me a simple way to run a simulation targetting either board and using a variety of tools. It is very possilbe to run xilinx specific designs in altera's modelsim and altera specific designs in xilinx's isim

The currnet FPGA boards I own/target:
Digilent Nexys2
Altera DE2-115

The current plan for simulation tools are:
Xilinx ISIM (working)
Altera Modelsim
Icarus Verilog 
GPL CVER
NCVerilog 

Development Platform:
Ubuntu 10.04 LTS x86_64
XEmacs
Xilinx ISE 12.2
Altera QuartusII/Modelsim 11.1
Python 2.6.5
